# Solar_Power_Plants
This is a Data Analysis case solved by me for a Renewable Energy Company designing, building and maintaining Photovoltaic powe plants.

The Dataset included the energy production performance of 3 of their power plants over a 3-years period.

The questions received from the company were the following:

Quantitative Questions:
- What is the approximate DC capacity of each PV installation in kWp?
- What is the approximate performance ratio (PR) of each installation in 2018, 2019 and 2020?
- What percentage of the data could be considered invalid?

Qualitative Questions
- For a few example datapoints explain why you flagged them as invalid.
- If there is a seasonal difference in performance, explain why this might be the case.

Additional Questions
- How might you approach visualisation of the data to inform non-subject experts of the issues seen?
- What other details can you infer about the parks? Can you estimate their approximate location?
